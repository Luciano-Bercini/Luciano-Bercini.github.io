<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p> 
<p> 
    The game is powered  by the Unity game engine (that is, made with Unity), and as such, the application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to,
    the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, country of install, and information about the way you use the application.

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> 
<p>
    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. 
    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
    This Service does not use cookies directly.
    However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
    You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.
    If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>
    Our Service allows the user to take control of their data by opting-out of personalized ads and analytics data collection.
    You can do so at the start of the game, or later, in the settings.
    If you opt-in to data collection, you confirm that you are at least 16 years old.
    When we collect personal information, we do not know the age of our players.
    We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16.
    If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with Personal Information, please contact us.
    If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 16 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
    Although the graphical content of the games may be suitable for younger audiences, there are multiple reasons for responsible developers to apply a minimum age of 16.
    Some of these reasons are in-app purchases and privacy.
    Please note: When you download our games from e.g. Google Play or Apple App Store you will find published age recommendations in the Apps description.
    However, these age or maturity classifications refer only to the content suitability (similar to movie ratings G, PG or PG-13 in the U.S., but related to gameplay, animations, etc.) according to the respective rating body responsible for such ratings.
    As these ratings are done independently by a third party without our contribution, they are not necessarily in line with our Terms of Service.
</p>
<p><strong>What are my opt-out rights and data-deletion rights?</strong></p>
<p>
    You can opt-out of the personalized ads through the App's settings.
    You can opt-out of the analytics data collection through the App's settings, and you can request your data to be deleted.
</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p> 
<p>
    This privacy policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
    We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new privacy policy here. 
    You are advised to consult this privacy policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
